# Optimal Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This is an AI that plays tic-tac-toe optimally (i.e., it cannot lose). 

The AI works by using the search algorithm *alpha-beta pruning* to find the best possible moves. Alpha-beta pruning is essentially a far more efficient version of *minimax*, a recursive adversarial search algorithm. 

On a high level, minimax works by playing out different scenarios, seeing which scenario is optimal for the computer, and choosing the best move assuming the opponent (user) plays optimally.
