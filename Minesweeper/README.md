# Minesweeper AI

This is an AI that plays the puzzle game minesweeper optimally.

Minesweeper is a logic-based game played on rectangular board. The objective is to locate a number of randomly-placed "mines" by clicking on "safe" squares while avoiding the squares with mines. If the player clicks on a mine, the game ends. Otherwise, a number between 0 and 8 is displayed that identifies the total number of mines present in the eight neighboring squares.
