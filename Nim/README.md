# Nim AI

This is an AI that teaches itself to play Nim through reinforcement learning.

In the game Nim, we begin with some number of piles, each with some number of objects. Players take turns: on a playerâ€™s turn, the player removes any non-negative number of objects from any one non-empty pile. Whoever removes the last object loses.
