# Traffic Sign Classifier

This is an AI to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The reason why we typically use CNNs in computer vision is because they more closely model the way humans process an image, looking at regions of an image and extracting features.

The dataset used is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.
